Write a simple to-do-item application in Java. It should support the following features,
  Add a to-do item
  Delete a to-do item
  View the to-do items

Description:
Make sure to structure your program in a modular way. 
In this case, that means you would have a command-line application which uses a class 
that holds the to-do items internally and provides public methods to add an item, delete an item, 
and provide the list of to-do items.
